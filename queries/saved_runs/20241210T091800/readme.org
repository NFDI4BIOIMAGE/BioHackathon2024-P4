- Servers: ontop, fuseki
- number of query repeats: 30
- client ip: 128.176.254.12
- client hostname: micropop046
- client software: apache-jena-5.2.0/bin/rsparql
- rsparql version reported as 4.2.0
- connection: vpn to uni-muenster
- note: all queries were run once about 30min before. Noting reduced
  query time on the 00-construct and other queries. Caching?

:END:
- executing all queries
- Connected to MÃ¼nster VPN
- Server host: 10.14.28.137
- checked all queries can be executed.
- query 09 failed, moved it to [[queries/query_foundry]].
- observed that queries run after the test respond faster, suspect
  there is some caching going on.
- results are saved in [[/queries/saved_runs/20241210T091800]]

#### Discussion
In all queries, ontop's query response time is faster than fuseki. Must be aware of caching, hence should try other query submission strategy (-> see Run 2, Run 3)
