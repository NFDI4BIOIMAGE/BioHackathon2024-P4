This directory contains graphs of defined size (indicated by filename, e.g. 1k = 1000 triples.)

The query to construct these graphs is

#+begin_example
construct {?s ?p ?o} where {?s ?p ?o} limit 1000
#+end_example

To check a graph's size, run the query

: select (count(?s) as ?ns) where {?s ?p ?o.}
